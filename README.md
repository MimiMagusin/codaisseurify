<h1> CodaisseurUp</h1>

Created for the 9 week intensive program at Codaisseur. The second project I built completely on my own,more thinking was involved. Again, a web app with basic CRUD functions a 'clone of Spotfiy'. There are artists with songs, you can add artists and songs, edit and remove them. I built an API and make use of a PostGresql database. I made use of AJAX, to automatically update the browser, there are however still some bugs that need to be fixed. Up to the API and AJAX commits, this project has been built through test driven development.
